Hello, my name is Cash Globe. Three words that describe me are: close-minded, dull, hyper-extroverted. One of my favorite hobbies is listening to country music. There is nothing better than being able to sit down and listen to AMAZING four chord songs about beer and tow-trucks. Country music gives me a way to tap into my inner cowboy and enjoy sitting back in my 3500 with a pack of PBR and a cowboy hat on!!!!!
